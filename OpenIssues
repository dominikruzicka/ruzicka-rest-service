 - make "public List<Employee> getEmployees()" be capable of returning Error as well

 - differentiate ErrorResponse return value by methods that return this class (now is the same for all methods "Operation failed")
 - + make better error and valid response structure
 - send request with many params but in body

 - create another DB for production (now have just one for both environments
 - set correct time in DB for record_created_date (it CR minus 2 hours)

 - make validation for mail on DTO level
